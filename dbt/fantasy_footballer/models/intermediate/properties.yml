  - name: int__strength_of_schedule
    description: >
      Calculates Strength of Schedule (SOS) metrics for each team-year combination

      using the formula: SOS = (2/3)*OW + (1/3)*OOW.

        description: >
          Composite Strength of Schedule score calculated as (2/3)*OW + (1/3)*OOW.
          Higher values indicate a more difficult schedule. This weighted formula
          gives more importance to direct opponent quality than indirect opponent quality.
