  - name: int__strength_of_schedule
    description: >
      Calculates Strength of Schedule (SOS) metrics for each team-year combination
      based on opponent winning percentages. The model computes metrics for both
      games already played and games remaining in the season. Key metrics include:
      Opponent Wins (OW), Opponent's Opponent Wins (OOW), and composite SOS scores
      using the formula: SOS = (2/3)*OW + (1/3)*OOW. The 'R' suffix (e.g., OWR, SOSR)
      indicates metrics calculated for remaining games only.
    columns:
      - name: year
        description: >
          The season year for which the strength of schedule is calculated.

      - name: sos
        description: >
          Composite Strength of Schedule score for games already played, calculated
          as (2/3)*OW + (1/3)*OOW. Higher values indicate a more difficult schedule
          faced so far. This weighted formula gives more importance to direct
          opponent quality than indirect opponent quality.
